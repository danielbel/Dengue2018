# Dengue2018
This is my project as part of DrivenData analytics competition looking to predict the total cases of dengue spread in two differnt cities. 
First I start by doing some exploratory data anylsis ( EDA) , and then modelling predictions with multiple linear regression, negative binomial, and a small try with ARIMA.
